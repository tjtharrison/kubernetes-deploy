# kubernetes-deploy

Ansible playbooks for deploying a 3 node Kubernetes cluster with 1 master node and 2 worker nodes. The default user 
that will be used is `k8sadmin` so this user must exist on your servers (with sudo permissions).

# Ansible setup

Your local machine will need to have Ansible installed. This can be done with the following command:

```
brew install ansible
```

# Pre-requisites

This project assumes that you have 3 Ubuntu servers set up and configured with access via ssh keys and configured in 
your `~/.ssh/config` file. 

Because the installation of Kubernetes requires the ability to run commands as root, you will need to be able to 
sudo on the servers without a password. 

This can be done by running the following command on each of the servers:

```
echo "<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/<username>
```

The ansible playbooks deploy metallb as the load balancer for the cluster. This requires that you have a range of IP 
defined in a config map.

Create a file in the repository named `metallb-config.yaml` with the following contents (replacing the IP addresses):

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.100
```

# Host configuration

```
Host master
    HostName <master-ip>
    User ubuntu

Host worker-1
    HostName <worker-1-ip>
    User ubuntu
    
Host worker-2
    HostName <worker-2-ip>
    User ubuntu
```

You will need to create a `hosts` file in the root of the project with the following contents:

```
[master]
<master>

[worker]
<worker-1>
<worker-2>
```

You can then test that Ansible can connect to the servers with the following command:

```
ansible -i hosts all -m ping
```

# Running the playbooks

The playbooks can be run with the following command:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts install.yaml
```

Once the playbook has completed you should have a fully functional Kubernetes cluster!
